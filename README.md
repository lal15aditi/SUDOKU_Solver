# SUDOKU_Solver
This is our first screen, which is representing the first page of the project where we see there is a "Start" button. When we click on this Start button, it enters into another page.
As the name indicates, the project is to solve a Sudoku puzzle. It also includes some special features. 
Sudoku is a combinatorial number-placement puzzle with a 9 x 9 cell grid partially filled in with numbers from 1 to 9. The goal is to fill the remaining, blank fields with the rest of the numbers so that each row and column will have only one number of each kind.

In this page, we can see a panel from top to bottom having different buttons- Reset, Exit, Solution, Check, 9x9 grid, in which some blocks are already filled/occupied and rest are empty (to be solved). There are select buttons from 1 to 9 to fill in the empty blocks.
